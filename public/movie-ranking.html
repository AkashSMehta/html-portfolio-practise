<h1>The Best Movies According To Akash</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>My favorite forever. I can watch it as many times I'd want and still have the same feeling. "Hope is a good thing. Maybe the best of things. And no good thing ever dies."</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Time is of the essence. What a mind-boggling movie. Love it.</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Another all time classic by Nolan. "Those aren't mountains, those are waves."</p>
